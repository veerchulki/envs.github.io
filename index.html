        <h2>Standout Topics</h2>
        <h3>What is Environmental Racism?</h3>
        <p>Environmental racism as a term was created by Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. in 1982 but there was oppression going on long before that. 
            Environmental racism addresses the intentional destruction of communities primarily populated by African Americans, Latines, Indigenous 
            People, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, migrant farmworkers, and low-income workers. The separation of communities by race can be
             accredited back to the practice of redlining in residential areas. Redlining came from the government mapping out city places 
             as to where POC could and could not live. White community members lived in areas far away from train tracks, highways, and garbage 
             dumps and even though most restrictions on redlining have been removed there is still a recognizable segregation of the communities. 
             The first complaint to garner national attention was in 1982 in a rural Black community in North Carolina where they found 
             carcinogenic compounds in the soil. Despite protests to stop the waste site from going in, it was still put into a residential 
             neighborhood and leaked compounds into the community drinking water. This first incident was one that helped to spark the whole 
             environmental justice movement. Environmental racism is not just an issue in the US but rather a globalized issue. With the 
             increase in population and corresponding increase to consumerism, there are large issues with dumping of pollutants in the global 
             south or shipments of batteries to Mexico.  
        </p>
        <h3>What is Unsustainable Waste Management?</h3>
        <p> Humans produce waste as a product of existing but there is a difference between sustainable and unsustainable waste management. 
            Unsustainable waste means that its generation, collection, processing, and disposal methods negatively impact the environment in a way 
            that will affect future generations. Humans dispose of over two billion metric tons of unsustainable waste a year. 38% of that waste is 
            dumped, burned or discarded irresponsibly. Landfills are the most common method of discarding waste but they lead to an exacerbation 
            of climate change. Open landfill sites allow for greenhouse gasses to be released directly into the atmosphere. Unsustainable development
             leads to a degradation of the environment, especially in areas with a greater risk of flooding, displacement, and landslides. It throws
              off the natural balance between the environment and socio-economic development. The demand for new development is leading to the 
              depletion of green spaces and the close proximity of waste dumping leads to loss of soil quality, destruction of natural areas, 
              and spoiling of habitats. Unsustainable waste management also leads to negative health effects on people. Generations following 
              improper waste management are suffering from illnesses related to unsustainable practices. </p>

        <h2>Connecting Race to Waste Management</h2>
        <h3>Structural/Systemic Racism and Waste Management</h3>
        <p>Waste management has long been a critical issue for communities worldwide, but the systems in place today often reflect a deeper, 
            systemic inequality tied to race. The connection between race and unsustainable waste management practices can be traced to structural 
            racism, colonial legacies, and public policies that disproportionately burden communities of color. These communities face a higher 
            risk of exposure to environmental hazards such as landfills, incinerators, and toxic waste sites—issues that go far beyond environmental
             concerns and are deeply tied to social and racial justice. Structural racism plays a pivotal role in how waste management systems are 
             designed and implemented. Communities of color, particularly low-income neighborhoods, are more likely to be situated near polluting 
             facilities such as waste dumps and incinerators. This is not a coincidence but a direct result of historical and ongoing racial 
             inequalities in the U.S. and around the world. The systemic nature of this inequality is well-documented, and the environmental 
             risks associated with it are profound. In many cases, waste management facilities are sited in areas where land is cheaper—often 
             near marginalized communities that have had little power to resist these decisions. As highlighted in the readings for this course, 
             this is an example of environmental racism: the placement of harmful waste management facilities in communities of color, which leads 
             to disproportionate exposure to toxins and pollution (Beyond Toxics). Colonialism's enduring impact continues to shape global waste 
             practices, as many Western countries still export their waste to less-developed, predominantly non-white nations. This practice, 
             referred to as environmental colonialism, is an extension of colonial exploitation, where the land and people of colonized regions 
             continue to bear the burden of industrialized nations' excess waste (Pollution is Colonialism). Not only does this reinforce racial 
             disparities, but it also exacerbates environmental degradation in already vulnerable communities.
             </p>
        <h3>Improper Waste Management and Public Health</h3>
        <p>The improper management of waste, especially in communities of color, has direct and detrimental impacts on public health. Waste sites, 
            including landfills and incinerators, often release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the surrounding environment, affecting air, 
            water, and soil quality. These pollutants have been linked to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, cancers, and 
            developmental disorders. Research has shown that these facilities are disproportionately located near low-income, Black, Indigenous,
             and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, contributing to the racial and health inequities we see today (Environmental Colonialism, 
             the Root Cause of Our Planet’s Crisis).  Moreover, when waste management systems fail to prioritize the health and safety of these 
             communities, it not only harms individuals but also perpetuates social and economic disparities. For example, in the United States, 
             communities like Cancer Alley in Louisiana have faced decades of environmental degradation due to the concentration of industrial plants
              and waste sites in predominantly Black neighborhoods. The residents of these areas have fought for years to bring attention to the 
              environmental injustices they face, yet their concerns are often ignored or dismissed. This failure to protect marginalized communities
               highlights the unequal distribution of environmental burdens and the need for more inclusive, sustainable policies.

        <h2>Real-World Action</h2>
        <h3>Flint Water Crisis</h3>
        <p>Because government representatives consistently disregarded and discounted the worries of a low-income, predominately Black 
            neighborhood regarding the quality of their water, the Flint water disaster is regarded as an illustration of systematic racism. 
            Because decision-makers ignored the grievances of Flint residents, postponed action, and failed to offer essential protections, 
            the Michigan Civil Rights Commission concluded that systematic racism was to blame for the crisis' poor response. Poor infrastructure,
             pollution, and a lack of government accountability disproportionately affect underprivileged populations, a situation that is reflected
              in the crisis and larger patterns of environmental injustice.</p>
        <h3>Houston Fifth Ward Contamination</h3>
        <p>Because systemic racism delays critical remediation measures and disproportionately exposes vulnerable groups to dangerous circumstances,
             it contributes to environmental malpractice in waste management. This pattern is demonstrated by the circumstances in Houston's
              Fifth Ward. This community, which is primarily Black and Hispanic, has been plagued by contamination for decades due to a former 
              Southern Pacific wood treatment plant that was later acquired by Union Pacific.

            The EPA took a long time to look into the matter, even after years of resident complaints and proof of a cancer cluster. 
            Recent soil tests conducted by the EPA found dangerous concentrations of carcinogens such as benzo(a)pyrene and dioxins in some places, 
            but experts said the amounts did not necessitate quick action. This lack of urgency is indicative of a larger pattern whereby minority 
            communities experience longer exposure times and greater health risks as a result of delayed reactions to environmental concerns.
            
            Communities of color are disproportionately affected by waste management decisions, such as the location of toxic facilities, which is 
            an example of systemic racism in action. Because these communities frequently lack political clout, neglect and insufficient 
            rehabilitation attempts result. The Fifth Ward case demonstrates how governments and corporations can avoid accountability by putting
             business interests ahead of public health and thereby perpetuating environmental injustice.
            </p>
        <h3>What Needs to Change</h3>
        <h4>Corporate Accountability for Environmental Cleanup Is Required</h4>
        <p>Instead of making residents fight for decades for remediation, companies like Union Pacific, which have a history of damaging communities 
            (as demonstrated in Houston's Fifth Ward), should be legally obligated to clear up contamination promptly. Instead of placing the cost on
            taxpayers or letting communities suffer, governments need to enact stronger regulations that force polluters to pay for the 
            decontamination of their soil and water.</p>
            
        <h4>A prohibition on facilities that handle hazardous waste close to residential areas</h4>
            
        <p>Due to discriminatory urban planning and lax zoning regulations, a large number of industrial plants and hazardous waste facilities 
            are located in low-income, primarily Black, and Latino neighborhoods. To stop new toxic waste facilities from being built close to 
            residential areas, a national strategy must be implemented. To stop more harm, existing trash dumps in underprivileged communities 
            should also be moved or outfitted with better safety features.</p>
            
            
        <h4>Environmental Justice Funds at the Federal and State Levels</h4>
            
        <p>The establishment of specialized environmental justice funds by the government would enable affected communities to receive funding for 
            independent environmental testing, legal disputes, and healthcare projects. Affected residents should have direct money to address 
            ontamination, relocate if needed, and receive medical treatment for illnesses like cancer caused by pollution, rather than depending on 
            slow-moving investigations like the EPA's in the Fifth Ward.</p>
